# Genshin Machine Learning Model

This is a machine learning classifier that takes character data from the 2020 video game, Genshin Impact and classifies characters as a DPS, sub DPS, or support. Then by using the classified characters, the model randomly generates a team and classifies how quality the team is.

How It's Made:
Tech used: Python, SciPy and Scikit-learn

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write something. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

Lessons Learned:
No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those whoa this is awesome or wow I actually did it! moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
