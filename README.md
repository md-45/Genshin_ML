# Genshin Machine Learning Model

This is a machine learning classifier that takes character data from the 2020 video game, Genshin Impact and classifies characters as a DPS, sub DPS, or support. Then by using the classified characters, the model randomly generates a team and classifies how quality the team is.

How It's Made:
Tech used: Python, SciPy and Scikit-learn

I wanted to use the Genshin Impact characters as the data to build a hierarchical clustering because I had been playing the game for years and noticed an issue with data consolidation. Character data and team classification data are on two separate wiki pages, which makes finding the best characters to make the best overall team a difficult task. I wanted to practice classification and hierarchical clustering while solving a data problem pertinent to myself.

Lessons Learned:
I learned how to print random arrays, classify large datasets, and generate and interpret a dendrogram.
